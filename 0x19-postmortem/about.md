**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 4 hours, from 09:00 to 13:00 (UTC)
- **Impact:** Email delivery service outage; 30% of users experienced delayed or undelivered emails.

**Timeline:**
- **09:00:** Issue detected by monitoring system - spike in email delivery latency.
- **09:15:** Engineering team alerted through automated monitoring.
- **09:30:** Initial investigation focused on email servers and network infrastructure.
- **10:00:** Assumed root cause was a server overload due to increased traffic.
- **10:30:** Escalation to the DevOps team for further infrastructure insights.
- **11:00:** Misleading investigation into a potential DDoS attack.
- **11:30:** Incident escalated to senior engineering and DevOps leadership.
- **12:00:** Identified a misconfigured network switch causing packet loss.
- **13:00:** Issue resolved; email service performance back to normal.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** A misconfigured network switch was dropping packets intermittently, leading to email delivery delays.
- **Resolution:** Reconfigured the network switch settings to eliminate packet loss and restore normal email service operation.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **To Improve/Fix:**
  1. **Network Configuration Audits:** Regularly audit and validate network configurations to catch potential misconfigurations early.
  2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement more granular monitoring for network performance to quickly identify anomalies.
  3. **Automated Incident Response:** Develop automated response scripts for common network issues to expedite resolution.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. **Network Switch Configuration Review:** Conduct an immediate review of all network switch configurations to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations.
  2. **Monitoring System Upgrade:** Enhance monitoring tools to provide real-time alerts for packet loss and other network-related issues.
  3. **Incident Response Automation:** Develop scripts to automate response procedures for known network issues to minimize downtime.
  
**Postmortem Analysis:**

**Issue Detection:**
The issue was initially detected by our monitoring system, which identified a sudden spike in email delivery latency. This triggered an automated alert that notified the engineering team, allowing for a swift response.

**Actions Taken:**
The initial investigation focused on the email servers and broader network infrastructure, assuming a server overload due to increased traffic. However, this assumption led to a misleading path of investigating a potential DDoS attack. Escalation to the DevOps team provided insights into the infrastructure, ultimately leading to the identification of the misconfigured network switch.

**Misleading Paths:**
The assumption of a server overload and subsequent investigation into a DDoS attack proved to be misleading. This highlights the importance of remaining open to various possibilities during the initial stages of issue resolution.

**Escalation:**
The incident was escalated first to the DevOps team and later to senior engineering and DevOps leadership as the complexity and severity of the issue became apparent.

**Resolution:**
The root cause, a misconfigured network switch causing packet loss, was identified and promptly addressed by reconfiguring the switch settings. This resolved the issue, restoring email service performance to normal levels.

**Lessons Learned:**
This incident underscores the critical need for meticulous network configuration reviews and the importance of robust monitoring systems. Implementing automated incident response procedures for known issues can significantly reduce downtime and enhance the overall resilience of our services.

**Conclusion:**
The outage, though disruptive, served as a valuable learning experience. By implementing the corrective measures and addressing specific tasks outlined in this postmortem, we aim to fortify our systems against similar issues in the future, ensuring the continued reliability of our services.
